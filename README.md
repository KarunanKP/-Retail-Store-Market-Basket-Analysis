# -Retail-Store-Market-Basket-Analysis

Objective:
The objective of this analysis was to perform a market basket analysis on retail transaction data to uncover patterns in customer purchasing behavior and identify potential opportunities for product bundling, cross-selling, and targeted marketing.

What I Did:
1. Data Cleaning: The dataset was first cleaned in Excel to handle basic formatting issues. Further data cleaning operations were performed in Python using Pandas, including renaming columns, converting data types, and handling missing values.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I conducted an EDA in both Excel and Python to gain insights into the dataset. In Excel, I performed basic data profiling and visualization. In Python, I used libraries such as Pandas, and Plotly to analyze item popularity, sales by country, and top customers by total spending.

3. Association Rules Analysis: I used the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets in the dataset and generated association rules to identify relationships between items commonly purchased together.

Conclusion:
The market basket analysis revealed several insights, including strong relationships between complementary products, seasonal buying patterns, and opportunities for upselling and cross-selling. These insights can be leveraged by retailers to optimize product offerings, promotions, and marketing strategies to enhance customer experience and drive sales.
